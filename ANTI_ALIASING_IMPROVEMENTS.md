# Transparent Compressor Plugin

## Overview
This document describes the transparent compressor plugin implementation that prioritizes audio quality and transparency over aggressive anti-aliasing measures.

## Design Philosophy
The compressor is designed to be as transparent as possible while still providing effective dynamic range compression. This means:
- No frequency-dependent processing that could color the sound
- No aggressive anti-aliasing filters that could cut high frequencies
- Clean, uncolored compression with minimal artifacts
- Preserved signal integrity across the entire frequency spectrum

## Signal Path
The original signal path is completely preserved:
```
Input Gain → Sidechain Sum → Sidechain EQ → RMS Detection → Gain Computation → Gain Smoothing → Output Gain → Dry/Wet Mix
```

## Key Features

### 1. Transparent Processing
- **No High-Frequency Cuts**: No anti-aliasing filters that could affect frequencies above 19kHz
- **No Soft Clipping**: No artificial limiting that could introduce harmonics
- **Clean Gain Computation**: Unmodified gain reduction calculation for maximum transparency

### 2. Sidechain EQ
- **Purpose**: Enhances detector sensitivity at 1.5kHz for better compression response
- **Implementation**: RBJ biquad filter with threshold-coupled gain
- **Transparency**: Only affects the detector, not the main signal path

### 3. RMS Detection
- **Implementation**: Light averaging RMS detector for natural compression response
- **Transparency**: No artificial smoothing that could affect transient response

### 4. Gain Smoothing
- **Implementation**: Natural attack/release smoothing using exponential curves
- **Transparency**: Preserves the original compressor character without artificial limiting

## VST3 Compatibility
- Plugin is configured to build as VST3 format
- All necessary JUCE modules are included
- Standard JUCE audio processing interface used
- No platform-specific code that would prevent VST3 compatibility

## Performance Considerations
- Minimal CPU overhead for maximum efficiency
- No oversampling to maintain low latency
- Optimized for real-time performance
- Clean, efficient signal processing

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with high-frequency content (10kHz+ sine waves) - should pass through unchanged
2. Test with extreme compression settings (high ratio, low threshold) - should compress naturally
3. Test with fast attack/release times - should respond naturally
4. Verify no frequency-dependent artifacts in spectrum analyzer
5. Confirm VST3 compatibility in various DAWs
6. Test transparency by comparing bypassed vs processed audio

## Transparency Goals
- Frequency response should be flat when no compression is applied
- No phase shifts or group delay artifacts
- Natural compression response without artificial limiting
- Preserved transient response and dynamics
- Clean, uncolored sound character
